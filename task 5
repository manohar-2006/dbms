🔍 Definition

A SQL JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a common column between them.
It retrieves data that is related logically between multiple tables.

🧩 Basic Syntax
SELECT columns_from_both_tables
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;


Explanation:

table1 and table2 → Tables you want to join

column1 and column2 → Common columns between the two tables

The ON keyword specifies the matching condition

Example 1 — Join Two Tables Based on a Common Column

Tables:

Customers Table
customer_id	first_name
1	John
2	Mary
3	Bob
Orders Table
order_id	customer	item	amount
101	1	Laptop	1200
102	2	Phone	700
103	3	Tablet	900
Query
SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Orders.item
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer;


✅ Explanation:
This joins the Customers and Orders tables using the customer_id column.

🧾 Result:

customer_id	first_name	item
1	John	Laptop
2	Mary	Phone
3	Bob	Tablet
Example 2 — Join With WHERE Clause
SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer
WHERE Orders.amount >= 800;


✅ Explanation:
This returns only those customers whose order amount ≥ 800.

🧾 Result:

customer_id	first_name	amount
1	John	1200
3	Bob	900
JOIN Multiple Tables

You can join three or more tables by chaining JOIN operations.

Example 3 — Joining Three Tables

Let’s add a Shippings table.

shipping_id	customer	status
1	1	Delivered
2	2	Pending
3	3	Shipped
SELECT Customers.first_name, Orders.item, Shippings.status
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer
JOIN Shippings ON Customers.customer_id = Shippings.customer;


🧾 Result:

first_name	item	status
John	Laptop	Delivered
Mary	Phone	Pending
Bob	Tablet	Shipped

✅ Explanation:
This joins three tables based on matching customer_id (or customer) fields and retrieves columns from all of them.
