Steps for converting the ER diagram to the table
1.	Entity type becomes a table 
each entity type in the ER diagram becomes a table in the relational model.
From the ER diagram, the main entity types are:
•	STUDENT
•	LECTURER
•	COURSE
•	SUBJECTS
Each of these will be represented as a separate table in your relational database design.
For example:
•	The STUDENT entity becomes the STUDENT table.
•	The LECTURER entity becomes the LECTURER table.
•	The COURSE entity becomes the COURSE table.
•	The SUBJECTS entity becomes the SUBJECT table.
Each table will then contain columns that represent that entity's attributes (fields such as STUDENT_ID, STUDENT_NAME for the STUDENT table, and so on).
